Do not need to write a client
We will run the commands in a browser in the Tests section
We will open the server on the command line then go into the browser and type out those links/commands under Tests
Won't need to do anything special for a 404
We write 1 program for a proxy server.
Logic of the server will all be in the handler
Use a lot of the logic from the last homework (connection.java doesn't need to be modified but it does need to be used). Connection is a thread.
Server specifies the port number we're using
We write 1 piece of software. Redo the logic in the handler. Handler will open a socket with the proxy server on 8080.
Steps 4 and 5 is what we did in hw1 part 1 and 2. We don't really have to do much. We just copy and do stuff with URLs. We read from the origin server and write to the client.
We will use the mirror program to see what the browser will send our proxy server. Can skip and go straight to the handler and print what the browser sends me. Will need to parse it so we know the resource and can request it from teh origin server.
